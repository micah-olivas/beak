Beak is a toolkit for modeling biophysical and evolutionary associations in proteins. <br>
<br>
Beak addresses several common challenges in modeling evolutionary sequence data in the context of experimental protein biophysics and biochemistry. The first is that compiling and aligning large sequence datasets is too intensive to run on a personal laptop, making it difficult to integrate these steps in exploratory data analysis. Beak works within a local notebook environment and is designed to streamline sequence database queries and multiple sequence alignment by offloading these processes to a local server and discretely managing handoff. Beak's focus on ease-of-use in exploratory data analysis addresses a second challenge in curating sequence datasets: standardization. Search and alignment parameters are cached in a local working directory, making this information traceable and comparable between projects.

## Installation
Beak needs to first be installed before use. It requires `python>=3.8`. You can install Beak using:
```
git clone https://github.com/micah-olivas/beak.git && cd beak

pip install -e .
```

## Usage
Beak's functionality is divided into several broad areas.
### Search
### Alignment
### Visualization
